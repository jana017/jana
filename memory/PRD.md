# NivX Machines — PRD

## Problem Statement
NivX Machines (Cyber Security, AI, Tech firm) landing site. Tabs: About Us, Gallery, Threat Report, Careers, Services, Support. Threat Report shows real-time threat reports with Attack Chain (MITRE ATT&CK), Process Trees, images. Contact: Mobile 9059565125, Email info@nivxmachines.com. Real-time threat landscape.

## User Choices
- Landing page (single-page marketing site + admin).
- Threat reports: live external feed (CISA KEV) + admin panel CRUD.
- Careers: static roles, apply via email.
- Support: contact info only.
- Design: CLEAN CORPORATE / enterprise-security (Palo Alto / Cisco / Optiv / Trend Micro reference). Light-dominant, restrained heading sizes.
- Fonts: Outfit (headings), Inter (body), IBM Plex Mono (data). (Earlier tried Unbounded/JetBrains Mono — rejected.)
- Brand: logo provided (navy + orange #F5821F + blue #2E7DF5). Logo at /app/frontend/public/nivx-logo.webp.

## Architecture
- Backend FastAPI (/app/backend/server.py): JWT admin auth (Bearer/localStorage), threat CRUD (/api/threats), live CISA KEV feed (/api/live-feed, 30-min cache), admin + sample threats seeded on startup.
- Frontend React (light theme): Landing (Navbar, Hero, About, StatsBand, LiveThreatLandscape, ThreatDashboard, Services, Gallery, Careers, Contact) + /admin (login + dashboard). Lenis smooth scroll, framer-motion.

## Implemented (2026-07-08)
- All 6 sections + hero + live threat landscape + admin panel.
- Live CISA feed (1,635 CVEs) — CVE rows link to NVD detail (new tab).
- Live Attack Feed (ransomware.live recent victims, screenshots) — real-time online attack data.
- 7 detailed threat reports, each with MITRE attack chain, process tree, image. Featured brief uses an animated kill-chain node diagram + MITRE T-codes.
- Support "Request a Security Assessment" lead-capture form -> POST /api/leads (EmailStr validated); admin GET /api/leads.
- Admin delete uses shadcn AlertDialog (no native confirm).
- Transparent/light logo variants (nivx-logo-light.png for white nav, nivx-logo-transparent.png for navy footer).
- Full redesign: light corporate enterprise theme (Outfit/Inter/IBM Plex Mono).
- Tests: backend 13/13, frontend 100%.

## Credentials
- Admin: admin@nivxmachines.com / NivX@Admin2025 (see /app/memory/test_credentials.md)

## Backlog / Next
- P2: Smart OSINT — DONE (IOC analyzer: auto-detect + inline enrichment + prefilled deep-links).
- P2: Persist rate-limit in Redis/Mongo if scaling to multiple replicas (currently in-memory per worker).
- P2: Lead management enhancements — notes/assignee, filter by status.
- P2: Unit42 reader — search within very large IOC tables.

## Latest (2026-07-08, session 2)
- Threat Intelligence: type facets + date-range + pagination over ~395 Unit42 reports; in-app report reader (notes/refs/IOC table + copy-all).
- OSINT section: 5 tool quick-links + SMART IOC ANALYZER (/api/ioc-lookup): classifies hash/IP/domain/URL, live no-key enrichment (Shodan InternetDB + ip-api for IPs, urlscan search for domains/URLs), prefilled deep-links (VT/AbuseIPDB/Talos/urlscan/X-Force).
- Admin: Leads tab with status workflow (new/contacted/qualified/archived) + CSV export.
- Anti-spam on lead form (honeypot + IP rate limit 3/10min).
- Global scroll-to-top button (Lenis-aware, positioned to clear Emergent badge).
- Responsive verified (mobile 390 / tablet 820, no overflow). Tests: backend 24+7/… all pass; frontend 100%.
